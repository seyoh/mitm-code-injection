To use the proxy, you have to make a man in the middle first and redirect HTTP traffic to the proxy.
To do so, you can configure your firewall to redirect traffic from port 80 to the proxy. if you're using iptable, you can use the command: iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i [interface] -p tcp --dport 80 -j REDIRECT --to-port 80
and then use Ettercap to perform an Arp spoofing attack.
